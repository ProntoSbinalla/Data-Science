    1.	Write a function that divides two numbers, but handle the case where the denominator is zero.
    2.	Create a function that checks if a given vector is numeric, and if not, raise a custom error message.
    3.	Use tryCatch to handle the error in reading a non-existent file using read.csv().
    4.	Write a function that takes a numeric vector and raises a warning if any element is negative.
5.	Create a function that opens a connection to a file, performs some operations, and ensures the connection is closed using on.exit().
    6.	Write a loop that iterates over a large range of numbers, but provide a way to interrupt execution using tryCatch.
7.	Create a function that calls another function, but if an error occurs, print the traceback using traceback().
8.	Use tryCatch to handle both errors and warnings that may arise during the execution of a function.
9.	Write a function that performs a complex calculation, but handle different types of errors that may occur during the calculation.
10.	Write a function that performs several operations, each wrapped in a tryCatch block to handle errors separately.
    11.	Create a function that takes a filename as input and tries to read it, but if an error occurs, print the error message using conditionMessage()
12.	Write a function that tries to connect to a database, but handle specific error conditions such as authentication failure or database not found.
13.	Develop a function that attempts to load a package and uses it if available, but falls back to an alternative method if the package is not installed.
14.	Write a function that calls another function multiple times, but if an error occurs in any iteration, continue with the next iteration without stopping the loop.
    15.	Create a function that expects a data frame as input, but handle the case where a different data type is provided.
16.	Write a function that opens a database connection, performs some operations, and ensures that the connection is closed even if an error occurs.
    17.	Develop a function that checks the memory usage of an object and raises an error if it exceeds a certain threshold.
18.	Write a function that logs errors to a file using tryCatch and sink().
19.	Create a function that downloads a file from a URL, but handle the case where the connection is interrupted or times out.
